OpenWeatherMapApi

The goal of this application is to learn about API's, and how they are built and accessed. The user is asked to input a location, and when he does it goes 
into the Open Weather Map data and releases all of the weather information that it has. The application calls in the Open Weather Map API, and than puts 
all of the information on the screen.
